## 📊 Phase 2: FAQ Schema - What You're Getting

### For Each Service Page:
- **5 high-intent questions** generated from page content
- **BLUF-formatted answers** (one-liner + context)
- **JSON-LD schema** ready to deploy
- **200+ word FAQ content** (already written)

### Example: Ghost-Writing Page
```
Q: "Is ghostwriting legal?"
A: "Yes, completely legal and standard practice. [2-3 sentences context]"

Q: "Who owns the copyright?"
A: "You (author) own 100% of rights and royalties. [context]"

Q: "Can I publish on Amazon?"
A: "Yes, without disclosing ghostwriting. [context]"

Q: "How much does it cost?"
A: "$5,000–$50,000+ depending on scope. [context]"

Q: "How long does it take?"
A: "3–12 months depending on complexity. [context]"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Structured for AI extraction (Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Claude)
- Targets "People Also Ask" search features
- Increases click-through from search results
- Drives qualified traffic (these are real customer questions)
