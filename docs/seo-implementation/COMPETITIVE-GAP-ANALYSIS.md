## 🔍 Manual Gap Analysis Checklist

If you prefer manual research over Semrush:

1. **Search each competitor domain in Google:**
   - `site:writersrepublic.com`
   - Review their top pages
   - Note keywords in titles/headings

2. **Use Google Search Console (theirs if accessible):**
   - Look at "Search Results" report
   - Note top-performing keywords
   - Identify patterns

3. **Check Google SERP features:**
   - Search "ghostwriting services"
   - Note who ranks top 10
   - Review their page structure/content

4. **Analyze Search Intent:**
   - Commercial keywords (people ready to buy)
   - Transactional keywords (intent to take action)
   - Informational keywords (research phase)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Gap Keyword Success

1. **Prioritize long-tail variations:** "hire a ghostwriter for fiction" beats "ghostwriting" (less competition, more intent)

2. **Focus on transactional keywords first:** These drive conversions faster than informational keywords

3. **Use competitor content as inspiration, not copy:** Read top-ranking content, but create better/more comprehensive versions

4. **Internal linking is critical:** Link gap keyword pages together to build topical authority

5. **Measure what matters:** Track leads, not just rankings. One qualified lead > 100 unqualified visitors
