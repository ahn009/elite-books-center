## 🐛 Troubleshooting: Schema Not Appearing

### Issue: Schema not in page source
**Solution:**
1. Verify include statement is on correct line
2. Check file path is correct: `'faq-schema-ghostwriting.php'`
3. Ensure file exists in same directory
4. Check for PHP errors: `error_log` or `php -l filename.php`

### Issue: Schema appears but validator shows errors
**Solution:**
1. Go to https://validator.schema.org/
2. Paste full page URL
3. Look for errors section
4. Common issue: Missing or extra commas in JSON
5. Fix in .php file: re-create FAQ schema file

### Issue: Schema valid but no rich results
**Solution:**
1. Schema is correct but needs time to index
2. Wait 1-4 weeks for first rich results
3. Monitor Search Console > Enhancements > FAQPage
4. Ensure sufficient page traffic

### Tip 2: Update FAQ Answers Over Time
- Monitor real search queries in GSC
- Update answers to match actual user searches
